	 * A jar is a zip file of all compiled classes
	 * Modifiers: Private can only be accessed by members in the same class
	 * Protected: members within the same package can see each other
	 * Final: It can not be changed once it is created
	 * Static: a non static method can be called by each instance of the class( one instance can use a method and they do not commun
	 * with each other)/ static can be used between instances.
	 * Abstract class: a class that can not be instantiated like the math class
	 * Abstraction is being able to use the method but not knowing how the method works.
	 * Encapsulation LOOK UP
	 * Inheritance STudent and teacher classes, have common attribute names.. make another class called person with those common attributes(super class) attributes
	 * that are not common are not placed in the super class.
	 * Annotation begins with @, is a supressed warning
	 * Deprecated method is a warning that a method will be replaced with a newer method
	 * Overload same method named twice but with different arguments
	 *
